# Technologies Used:

# HTML, Javascript, CSS

# Getting Started:

# Make sure to hit the Start button at the bottom to randomize the cards and then you can start matching. Feel free to use the Reset button to clear the board and go again!

# Next Steps:
# There are some edge cases in my game where it breaks the code. For example, if I click the cards too fast, the card will not flip or I will get a match on the same card.

# Another example would be if I flip 2 cards and while they are still flipped, I click a 3rd card, it will bug out the animation and the cards.

# I think the best next steps would be to refactor my code so it looks cleaner and runs better to cover the above-mentioned edge cases.

# Experience:

# Overall, I like the aesthetic of my game, but it does not run as optimally as I'd like. I am very proud of myself though, that I actually built a browser game (with a lot of help!)

# My biggest challenge was the Reset button - couldn't figure it out so I got some help from TA's and Eric. I learned that I cannot directly change the class of a node list (which I/we were attempting to do which is why my Reset button was not working) and that I need to iterate over each element instead.

# Key learnings - How important it is to use console.log, node lists and arrays are different, breaking problems down as small as possible and then tackle the next issue/problem, how to implement a downloaded font into CSS, and how much code is required for such a simple game.
