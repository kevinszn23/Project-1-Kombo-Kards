### Your chosen game 
> Brief 2-3 sentence description of your game

I chose Memory Matcher as my game.
I am hoping to incorporate the ILs and IAs in some capacity.
My game will also be minimalistic in terms of visuals.

### Basic User stories

The user will be met with a start screen where he/she can click "Start" or "Quit" and I am aiming to have a message display that says "Be comfortable with being uncomfortable, try it out!" if the user selects "Quit."

The timer will then start as soon as the user hits "Start."

The user will then have to click on the cards to match pairs.

Once all pairs are matched, the user wins and a display message that says "You win" appears.

If the timer runs out before the user matches all pairs, the user loses and a message that says "You lose" appears.
